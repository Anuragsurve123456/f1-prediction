# Real-Time F1 Predictions Using FastF1 API üèéÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time Formula 1 prediction system utilizing the [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/) Python library. FastF1 provides access to various F1 data, including lap timing, car telemetry, position data, tire information, weather conditions, event schedules, and session results. By leveraging these data points, our team intends to create a predictive model that offers insights and forecasts for ongoing and upcoming F1 races.
